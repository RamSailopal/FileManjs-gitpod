# Gitpod

To run a Gitpod with this repo:

1) Create a free/paid Gitpod account - https://www.gitpod.io/
2) Log into the account
3) Open a new browser tab and add **https://github.com/RamSailopal/FileManjs-gitpod** to the address - This will create a new Gitpod cloud instance.
4) Due to blocked cross origin requests, ports 3001 and 9100 need to be made public in Gitpod.
5) Due to blocked cross origin requests, A CORS browser add-on also needs to be added and enabled

   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en
6) Step 3 is for sample only. If you want to make changes to your own repo, first fork this repo and then add that repo after the **gitpod.io/#** prefix to create a new gitpod intance.
